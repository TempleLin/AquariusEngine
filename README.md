Current Plan:<br/>
1.Rewrite the engine to Java first, implement reflection to make it cross platform for Windows/Linux/MacOS/Android/Raspberry Pi<br/>
2.Add Python/C++ version to use it for desktop only (Possibly for pure machine learning usage)<br/>
3.Add C# version of the engine, make it cross platform for Window/Linux/MacOS/Xbox One/PS4/Switch<br/>
